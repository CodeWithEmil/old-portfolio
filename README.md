# Portfolio
This is my portfolio! I'm currently working on it, so there's many features, mistakes, errors, and that kind of stuff.

Technologies used were HTML, Sass (SCSS), and JavaScript. Initially, I thought about using React, but I didn't do it in the end due to some issues with my computer.

Hope you like it :)
